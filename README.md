# Flutter Server Middleware

Serve dynamic data alongside your static Flutter web app, no spinners or loading screens required.

## What is this?

Flutter web apps today are deployed a static sites. One drawback of this is that the site needs to be downloaded to the client

## Feature Ideas

- [x] Serve dynamic data alongside a static Flutter web app
- [ ] Create client side Flutter package to acceess data easily
- [ ] Support more ways to configure and serve data on the server (currently just a static JSON file, could offer a dashboard for static or do server side API calls)
- [ ] Create a simple way to self host the server with better documentation
- [ ] Offer hosting option for those who would rather pay than self host?

## Getting Started

This project has no easy way of being integrated into your Flutter app at the moment. If you want this type of functionality, fork and host the server yourself.
